# YouTube-Transcript-summarizer---Chorme-extension

‘YouTube Transcript Summarizer’ is a Chrome Extension that allows users to get a ‘summarized’ version of the transcripts of YouTube videos with a ‘single click’. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms such as ‘Latent Semantic Analysis’ (LSA) and ‘state-of-the-art Huggingface Transformer models’ to efficiently summarize the transcripts of YouTube videos with a single click. It is built on a ‘Flask Backend REST API’ to expose the summarization service to the client.
